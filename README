AphoticZone
By Sean Yeh

For HackNY Hackathon, Fall 2013

A very dark multiplayer online game. Abstract game set in a parallel world.
Your soul is dying and you must leech off other souls while acquiring stronger
weapons and visiting the world's favorite places on Foursquare.

Uses Foursquare, NYTimes, Etsy API's.

Node.js for server.

Please don't mind some of the ugly code. I did it all in less than a day :)
